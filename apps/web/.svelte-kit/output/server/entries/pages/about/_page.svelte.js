Telomere AI is a free, open-source desktop application that lets you analyze your raw genetic data from 23andMe, AncestryDNA, MyHeritage, or any VCF file — completely offline, on your own computer.</p> <p class="mt-3">We believe everyone deserves access to their genetic information without price barriers or privacy compromises.</p></div> <div class="card"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-3">Why "Telomere"?</h2> <p>Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of your chromosomes. They shorten with age, making them a direct biomarker of biological aging. The name reflects our focus: <strong class="text-text-primary">understanding longevity and health through genetics</strong>, not ancestry party tricks.</p></div> <div class="card"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-3">Privacy First</h2> <p>This is a desktop application. Your genetic data is processed entirely on your computer. No servers. No cloud. No accounts. No tracking. The app works fully offline after installation.</p> <p class="mt-3">Our codebase is open source — you can verify every claim we make by reading the code yourself.</p></div> <div class="card"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-3">Our Database</h2> <p>Our curated SNP database draws from peer-reviewed sources including ClinVar, SNPedia, PharmGKB, and published GWAS studies. Every SNP entry includes PubMed references so you can verify the science.</p> <p class="mt-3">We currently cover 200+ well-characterized SNPs across health risks, longevity, nutrigenomics, pharmacogenomics, traits, and carrier status — with more being added continuously.</p></div> <div class="card"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-3">Built By</h2> <p>Telomere AI is built by <a href="https://vaionex.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-accent-cyan hover:underline">Vaionex</a>, a technology company focused on building tools that make complex data accessible to everyone.</p></div> <div class="card bg-accent-amber/5 border-accent-amber/20"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-3">⚠️ Disclaimer</h2> <p>Telomere AI is for <strong class="text-text-primary">educational and informational purposes only</strong>.
