Many of these reactions are preventable — because they stem not from prescribing errors or allergies, but from predictable genetic variation in how individuals metabolize drugs. Pharmacogenomics, the study of how your genome influences your response to medications, is transforming this landscape by enabling clinicians to match the right drug at the right dose to the right patient.' },

Among the 57 human CYP genes, a handful are disproportionately important for drug metabolism: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2. Variants in these genes can dramatically alter enzyme activity, changing how quickly or slowly you process a medication.' },
        { type: 'p', text: 'Based on your CYP gene variants, you are typically classified into one of four metabolizer phenotypes. Poor metabolizers (PMs) have little or no functional enzyme activity, meaning drugs processed by that enzyme accumulate to potentially toxic levels. Intermediate metabolizers (IMs) have reduced but not absent activity. Normal (or extensive) metabolizers (NMs) process drugs at the expected rate. Ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs) clear drugs so quickly that standard doses may be therapeutically insufficient.' },

The CYP2D6 gene is located on chromosome 22q13.1 and is extraordinarily polymorphic — over 130 allelic variants have been catalogued by the Pharmacogene Variation Consortium (PharmVar).' },

Ultra-rapid metabolizers produce morphine so quickly and abundantly that standard codeine doses can cause respiratory depression and even death. The FDA issued a boxed warning in 2013 after multiple pediatric fatalities in CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers following routine tonsillectomy with codeine prescriptions. Conversely, poor metabolizers derive essentially no pain relief from codeine because the conversion to morphine never occurs.' },

The landmark TRITON-TIMI 38 trial demonstrated that CYP2C19 poor metabolizers had a 53% higher rate of cardiovascular events on clopidogrel (PMID: 19106084).
